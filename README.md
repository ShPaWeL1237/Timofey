Digit recognition using a neural network in Python is an important component of artificial intelligence. This is used for image and text recognition, as well as for machine learning, object classification and prediction of future events. In this article, we will discuss neural networks and prepare our very first neural network model in Python for digit recognition. To train a neural network, we will use the MNIST dataset containing images of printed digits.
